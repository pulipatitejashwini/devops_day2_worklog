# Git & GitHub Basics

# Overview
In this task, I set up a local Git environment, practiced version control, and linked it with a remote GitHub repository. I learned to track changes, create commits, manage branches, merge code, and perform rollbacks—fundamental skills for DevOps workflows and collaborative development. 

# Tools Used
Git 
GitHub 
Terminal (Git Bash / Linux Shell) 
Text Editor (Vim) 

# What I Did
Installed Git and configured global username and email. 
Initialized a local Git repository and understood the purpose of the .git directory. 
Created files and tracked changes using git status, git add, and git commit. 
Created a GitHub repository and linked it to the local repo using HTTPS/SSH. 
Pushed local commits to the remote GitHub repository. 
Practiced branching by creating a new branch, making changes, and merging it back to the main branch. 
Practiced rollback using git log and git checkout. 

# Repository Contents
README.md           – Task explanation. 
commands.md         – List of Git & GitHub commands used. 
screenshots/        – Screenshots of Git operations and GitHub push as evidence. 
file.txt           – Sample file used to practice commits and branching. 

# Outcome
Gained hands-on experience with Git and GitHub workflows. 
Learned to track changes, manage branches, and perform safe rollbacks. 
Improved confidence in version control practices, essential for DevOps and collaborative projects.
